# Avatar Generator

Welcome to the **Avatar Generator** web app! This simple and lightweight application allows you to generate random avatars similar to GitHub's style. Each time you click the "Generate" button, the app creates a unique avatar with a random pastel color, giving you a fresh and visually appealing design every time.

## Features

- **Random Avatar Generation**: Instantly create a unique avatar with just one click.
- **Pastel Color Palette**: Each avatar is generated with a random pastel background color, ensuring a soft and appealing aesthetic.
- **Simple and Fast**: Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the app is lightweight and responsive.

## How It Works

1. **HTML & CSS**: The structure and styling of the avatars are defined using HTML and CSS, ensuring a clean and modern look.
2. **JavaScript**: The core functionality is powered by vanilla JavaScript. Each time the "Generate" button is clicked, a new avatar is created with a random pastel color.
3. **Pastel Color Generator**: The app uses a custom function to generate soft pastel colors, ensuring each avatar has a gentle and visually pleasing background.
